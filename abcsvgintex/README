         ABCSVGinTeX

abcsvgintex is a LaTeX package for using inline ABC music to create scores in 
a LaTeX document.

ABC music found in an "abc" environment is written to an ABC temporary 
source file which is converted to PDF before being inserted in your document.

This is still an experimental package, and you will find the documentation 
at the beginning of abcsvgintex.sty. You may also play with example1.tex and 
example2.tex in folder "examples" to get a better understanding of how 
abcintex works.

abcsvgintex uses the \write18 command to convert ABC files, so you must use a 
TeX engine that supports this trick, and enable it (with the -shell-escape 
option for TeX live or MacTeX for instance). Its default configuration uses abc2svg
and abc2midi or MuseScore to process ABC files. It relies on some shell scripts that
are available at: https://github.com/Frederic-soft/abc2svgstuff

abcsvgintex uses a special version of keyval named keyvalx.sty that allows the 
definition of a default processing for unknown keys in options.
